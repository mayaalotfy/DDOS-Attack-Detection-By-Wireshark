# DDOS-attack-detection-by-wireshark
This repo contains a project focused on detecting Denial of Service (DoS) attacks using Wireshark. Utilizing a PCAP file with SYN flood data sourced from the internet, the project demonstrates the detection and analysis of such attacks. Included is a detailed video walkthrough showcasing the process of analyzing the PCAP file, identifying attack patterns, and visualizing traffic data. This project aims to provide insights into network security and enhance understanding of DoS attack mechanisms.
